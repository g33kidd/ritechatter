Join twitter chats with ease.  Land on a page that let's you log in with Twitter and you are with your chat peeps, chatting in convo. 

Set up chat pages to share with your existing chat participants - which wont have them running back to you for hand-holding.  Set each of the chats you manage as free (we supply ads) or Pro (your links, ads, and access to Pro widgets).

Connect with chat participants by listing, messaging about upcoming chats, schedule, and topics with an interface that is actually comprehensible. 

Do more with less actions.  Do the chat thing "Rite."  

Your chat peeps will love you for putting them on to RiteChatter.
